# CNN-DDQN

The objective of this project was to utilize candlestock images and a Double-Deep Q-network architecture for stock trading on the S&P 500.

Note that a folder "checkpoints" for the training checkpoints is not included in this repository as it is very large (8 GB)

The project is based off the work found in the paper "02_DRL candlestick CNN analysis.pdf". 

The lack of results, as well as a critique of the original paper "AM_Thesis (18).pdf" motivated me to terminate this project. (Along with the Efficient Market Hypothesis).
